2. Click on your account name at the top
3. Your address will be copied (starts with 0x...)

#### 2.2 Get Free MATIC from Faucets

**Option 3: QuickNode Faucet**
- Go to: https://faucet.quicknode.com/polygon/mumbai
- Connect wallet or paste address
- Request tokens

#### 2.3 Verify You Received MATIC
- Check MetaMask - you should see ~0.5-2 MATIC
- This is enough for thousands of transactions!

---

### Step 3: Export Your Private Key

**‚ö†Ô∏è SECURITY WARNING:**
- Only use this wallet for TESTNET
- Never share your private key
- Never use this key on mainnet with real money

### Step 4: Install Hardhat (Deployment Tool)

Open a terminal in your project folder:

```bash
cd /Users/surajbayas/Developer/Certify
npm install --save-dev hardhat @nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox
npx hardhat init
```

When prompted:
- Choose: "Create a JavaScript project"
- Press Enter for all defaults

---

### Step 5: Configure Hardhat

#### 5.1 Create hardhat.config.js

I'll create this file for you with the right configuration.

#### 5.2 Create .env file in root

Create a file named `.env` in `/Users/surajbayas/Developer/Certify/`:

```bash
# Paste your private key from Step 3 (remove 0x prefix if present)
PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key_here_without_0x_prefix

# Polygon Mumbai RPC
BLOCKCHAIN_RPC_URL=https://rpc-mumbai.maticvigil.com
```

**Example:**
```bash
PRIVATE_KEY=abc123def456...your64characterkey
BLOCKCHAIN_RPC_URL=https://rpc-mumbai.maticvigil.com
```

---

### Step 6: Deploy Smart Contract

#### 6.1 Deploy to Mumbai Testnet

Run this command:

```bash
cd /Users/surajbayas/Developer/Certify
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network mumbai
```

#### 6.2 Save the Contract Address

The output will show:
```
CertificateRegistry deployed to: 0x1234567890abcdef...
```

**Copy this address!** You'll need it in the next step.

---

### Step 7: Configure Your Application

#### 7.1 Update server/.env

Edit `/Users/surajbayas/Developer/Certify/server/.env`:

```bash
PORT=5001
NODE_ENV=development

# Paste your actual values here
BLOCKCHAIN_RPC_URL=https://rpc-mumbai.maticvigil.com
PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key_from_step_3
CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0x1234...your_contract_address_from_step_6

DB_PATH=./database.sqlite
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

#### 7.2 Restart Your Server

```bash
cd server
npm start
```

1. Go to http://localhost:3000
2. Click "Issue Certificate"
3. Fill in the details
4. Click "Issue Certificate"

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### "Insufficient funds for gas"
- Get more testnet MATIC from faucets
- You might need to wait 24 hours between requests

### "Invalid private key"
- Make sure you copied the full key
- Remove any "0x" prefix
- Check for extra spaces

### "Contract not deployed"
- Verify contract address in .env
- Check it exists on mumbai.polygonscan.com

### "Transaction taking too long"
- Mumbai testnet can be slow sometimes
- Wait 1-2 minutes
- Check transaction on PolygonScan

---

## üîê Security Reminders

‚úÖ DO:
- Use separate wallet for testnet
