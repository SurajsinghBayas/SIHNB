# Profile Button Fix - Dashboard Navigation Update

## Issue

Profile button was only showing in the Landing Page navbar, but not appearing in the dashboards after users logged in (Student, Institute, Company, Admin dashboards).

## Root Cause

Each dashboard has its own navbar component, and the Profile button was only added to the LandingPage.js navbar. The dashboard navbars were not updated to include the Profile button.

## Solution

Updated all four dashboard files to include the Profile button in their navigation bars.

## Profile Button Styling

All dashboard CSS files now include the `.btn-profile` class:

```css
.btn-profile {
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  gap: 8px;
  padding: 10px 20px;
  background: transparent;
  color: #667eea;
  border: 2px solid #667eea;
  border-radius: 8px;
  cursor: pointer;
  font-weight: 600;
  transition: all 0.3s;
}

.btn-profile:hover {
  background: #667eea;
  color: white;
}
```

**Design**:

- Outlined button style (transparent background with blue border)
- Matches the app's primary color (#667eea)
- Smooth hover transition (fills with blue, text turns white)
- Icon + text layout
- Positioned between user info and logout button

## Navbar Layout (All Dashboards)

```
[Logo] [Dashboard Name]        [User Info] [Profile] [Logout]
```

Example for Student Dashboard:

```
[🛡️ Certify Student]        [student@email.com] [👤 Profile] [🚪 Logout]
```
