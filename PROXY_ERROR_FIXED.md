# ✅ Proxy Error Fixed

## The Problem
```
Proxy error: Could not proxy request from localhost:3000 to http://localhost:5002/
ECONNREFUSED
```

## The Cause
The React client was configured to proxy to port **5002**, but the backend server wasn't running.

## The Solution

### 1. ✅ Server Running on Port 5002
```powershell
cd d:\CODING\NBHACAKTHON\Certify\server
$env:PORT="5002"
node index.js
```

**Server logs:**
```
⛓️  Blockchain service initialized
🚀 Server running on port 5002
📊 Environment: development
📦 Connected to SQLite database
✅ Certificates table ready
✅ Institutes table ready
🔌 PostgreSQL connection successful
✅ Users table initialized successfully
✅ Certificates table initialized successfully in PostgreSQL
```

### 2. ✅ Client Proxy Configured
`client/package.json`:
```json
"proxy": "http://localhost:5002"
```

### 3. ✅ React Client Running
```powershell
cd d:\CODING\NBHACAKTHON\Certify\client
npm start
```

**Client logs:**
```
Compiled successfully!
You can now view certify-client in the browser.
  Local: http://localhost:3000
```

## 🎯 Current Configuration

| Component | Port | URL |
|-----------|------|-----|
| **Backend Server** | 5002 | http://localhost:5002 |
| **React Client** | 3000 | http://localhost:3000 |
| **PostgreSQL (Neon)** | Remote | Cloud database |
| **Blockchain** | Local | Hardhat network |

## 🚀 How to Start the Application

### Terminal 1: Start Backend Server
```powershell
cd d:\CODING\NBHACAKTHON\Certify\server
$env:PORT="5002"
node index.js
```

Wait for:
- ✅ "Server running on port 5002"
- ✅ "PostgreSQL connection successful"
- ✅ "Certificates table initialized successfully in PostgreSQL"

### Terminal 2: Start React Client
```powershell
cd d:\CODING\NBHACAKTHON\Certify\client
npm start
```

Wait for:
- ✅ "Compiled successfully!"
- Browser opens to http://localhost:3000

---

## 🧪 Test the Connection

### 1. Test Backend Health
```powershell
curl http://localhost:5002/api/health
```

**Expected response:**
```json
{"status":"ok","message":"Server is running"}
```

### 2. Test Frontend
- Go to http://localhost:3000
- Page should load without proxy errors
- Check browser console (F12) - no connection errors

### 3. Test Login
- Click "Login"
- Email: `institute@university.edu`
- Password: `institute123`
- Should successfully login and redirect to dashboard

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Error: EADDRINUSE (Port 5002 already in use)

**Find the process:**
```powershell
netstat -ano | findstr :5002
```

**Kill it:**
```powershell
taskkill /PID <PID> /F
```

### Error: Cannot find module

**Make sure you're in the correct directory:**
```powershell
# For server
cd d:\CODING\NBHACAKTHON\Certify\server

# For client
cd d:\CODING\NBHACAKTHON\Certify\client
```

### Error: Proxy still not working

**Restart the React client:**
1. Stop client (Ctrl+C)
2. Start again: `npm start`
3. React needs restart to pick up proxy changes

## 📝 Port Configuration Files

### Server Port: `server/index.js`
```javascript
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 5001;  // Defaults to 5001
```

To use port 5002:
```powershell
$env:PORT="5002"  # Set before starting server
```

### Client Proxy: `client/package.json`
```json
{
  "proxy": "http://localhost:5002"
}
```

**Note:** Client must be restarted after changing proxy!

## ✅ Success Indicators

### Backend (Terminal 1)
```
✅ Server running on port 5002
✅ PostgreSQL connection successful
✅ Certificates table initialized
```

### Frontend (Terminal 2)
```
✅ Compiled successfully!
✅ webpack compiled successfully
```

### Browser
- ✅ http://localhost:3000 loads
- ✅ No proxy errors in console
- ✅ Can login successfully
- ✅ API calls work

---

## 🎊 Current Status

Both servers are running successfully:

✅ **Backend Server** - Port 5002  
✅ **React Client** - Port 3000  
✅ **PostgreSQL** - Connected  
✅ **Proxy** - Working  

**You can now:**
- ✅ Access the app at http://localhost:3000
- ✅ Login with test accounts
- ✅ Issue certificates (stored in PostgreSQL!)
- ✅ Verify certificates
- ✅ View dashboards

---

## 🔗 Quick Commands

### Start Everything
```powershell
# Terminal 1 - Backend
cd d:\CODING\NBHACAKTHON\Certify\server; $env:PORT="5002"; node index.js

# Terminal 2 - Client
cd d:\CODING\NBHACAKTHON\Certify\client; npm start
```

### Test Certificate Storage
1. Login as Institute: `institute@university.edu` / `institute123`
2. Click "Issue Certificate"
3. Fill form and submit
4. Check Terminal 1 for:
   ```
   🔄 Attempting to store certificate...
   ✅ Certificate stored in PostgreSQL (Neon)
   ```
