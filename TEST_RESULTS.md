---

## 🧪 Test Your Setup:

### 1. Issue a Test Certificate

1. Go to: http://localhost:3000
2. Click "Issue Certificate"
3. Fill in the form:
   - **Learner Name:** John Doe
   - **Email:** john@example.com
   - **Course Name:** Blockchain Development
   - **Institute Name:** Tech University
   - **Issue Date:** 2025-10-02
4. Click "Issue Certificate"

### 2. Check the Response

You should see:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "certificate": {
    "id": "uuid-here",
    "hash": "sha256-hash",
    "txHash": "blockchain-tx",
    "pdfUrl": "/certificates/file.pdf",
    "ipfsHash": "QmXoypizjW3WnKzXFwe...",  ← IPFS Hash!
    "ipfsUrl": "https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/...",  ← Your PDF on IPFS!
    "publicIpfsUrl": "https://ipfs.io/ipfs/...",
    "qrCode": "base64-data",
    "verifyUrl": "http://localhost:3000/verify/..."
  }
}
```

### 3. View on Pinata Dashboard

1. Go to: https://app.pinata.cloud/pinmanager
2. You should see your certificate PDF
3. Click to view/download from IPFS

### 4. Test IPFS Access

Copy the `ipfsUrl` from the response and:
- Open it in a new browser tab
- Your certificate PDF should download from IPFS!
- Try the `publicIpfsUrl` too (works on any IPFS gateway)

## 📊 What Happens When You Issue a Certificate:

1. ✅ **Generate PDF** - Creates beautiful certificate
2. ✅ **Upload to Pinata** - Stores PDF on IPFS network
3. ✅ **Get IPFS Hash** - Unique identifier (QmXoy...)
4. ✅ **Upload Metadata** - Stores certificate data as JSON on IPFS
5. ✅ **Store on Blockchain** - Saves IPFS hash on Polygon (when configured)
6. ✅ **Save to Database** - Stores all info locally
7. ✅ **Generate QR Code** - For easy verification

---

## 🎉 Your Certificates Are Now:

✅ **Decentralized** - Stored on IPFS, not just your server
✅ **Permanent** - Can't be deleted or modified
✅ **Globally Accessible** - Anyone can access via IPFS hash
✅ **Blockchain Verified** - IPFS hash stored on blockchain
✅ **Independently Verifiable** - Don't need your server to verify

---

## 📱 Next Steps:

### 1. Update Frontend (Optional)
Show IPFS links in the UI:
- Display "View on IPFS" button
- Show IPFS hash in certificate details
- Add "Download from IPFS" option

### 2. Set Up Blockchain (Recommended)
Follow `BLOCKCHAIN_SETUP.md` to:
- Deploy smart contract to Polygon Mumbai
- Store IPFS hashes on blockchain
- Enable true decentralized verification

### 3. Test End-to-End
- Issue certificate
- View on IPFS
- Verify on blockchain
- Share with employer
- Verify authenticity

---

## 🔍 Monitoring:

### Check Pinata Dashboard:
https://app.pinata.cloud/pinmanager

**You'll see:**
- All uploaded files
- Storage used
- Bandwidth used
- File metadata

### Check Server Logs:
Look for these messages:
```
✅ File uploaded to IPFS: QmXoy...
✅ JSON uploaded to IPFS: QmAbc...
```

---

## 💡 Pro Tips:

1. **IPFS Takes Time** - First access may take 30-60 seconds
2. **Multiple Gateways** - If one is slow, try another
3. **Pin Important Files** - Keep them pinned on Pinata
4. **Monitor Usage** - Check dashboard regularly
5. **Backup Locally** - Keep PDFs on server too

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting:

### If IPFS upload fails:
- Check server logs for errors
- Verify Pinata API keys in `.env`
- Check internet connection
- Verify Pinata account is active

### If can't access IPFS URL:
- Wait 1-2 minutes for propagation
- Try different gateway (ipfs.io, cloudflare-ipfs.com)
- Check if file exists on Pinata dashboard

### If seeing "mock" responses:
- Verify `.env` file has Pinata keys
- Restart server after adding keys
- Check for typos in keys
